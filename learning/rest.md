# CORS Errors 'Cross-Origin Resource Sharing'

CORS is a security mechanism by the browser

Doesn't happen within the same domain,
however CORS Errors occur when Client and Server are on different domains!

Example same domain:
Client: localhost:3000
Server: localhost:3000

Example different domain:
Client: localhost:4000
Server: localhost:3000
